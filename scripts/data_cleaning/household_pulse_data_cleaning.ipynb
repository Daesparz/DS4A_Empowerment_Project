    "\n",
    "Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Rep. Jimmy Panetta (D-Calif.) introduced legislation in their respective chambers to expand the Restaurant Meals Program, a little-known initiative that allows seniors, disabled and homeless people to use their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits to purchase discounted restaurant meals because these folks often canâ€™t cook for themselves or donâ€™t have access to a kitchen. The RMP is voluntary for states, and to date, only about three use the program, including California, Arizona and Rhode Island. The low participation rate, in part, reflects the public health concern that fast-food chains would mostly sign up for the program, affecting the well-being of the people who receive benefits, Murphy said.\n",
    "\n",
    "But as the unemployment rate swells, as grocery store shelves grow more depleted and as public transportation continues to pose a threat for low-income Americans who need it to visit supermarkets, states have been looking to SNAP for solutions. Governors in Louisiana and Texas have both said they would like to see the RMP expanded to feed their citizens and to bolster the hobbled hospitality industry. This month, several groups, including the National Council of Chain Restaurants and the National Restaurant Association, wrote to the U.S. Agriculture Department to recommend that Secretary Sonny Perdue open the RMP to more SNAP recipients and more restaurants.\n",
